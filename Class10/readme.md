# Exercise 1: Implementing CRUD Operations in the `Movie App`

In this exercise, you will work with the `MovieRepository`, Service and Controller class, which is responsible for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on notes in the MoviesApp database. Your task is to implement the existing methods to make the repository and other components fully functional.

## First steps:


1. **Database Configuration:**

   Adjust the connection string in the Program.cs file to match your database setup.

2. **Add a Migration:**

   Using Entity Framework, create a migration to represent changes in your data model. Use the following command: **add-migration YourMigrationName**

3. **Update the Database:**
    
    Apply the migration to update the database schema with the following command: **update-database**

# Exercise: Implementing Movie Repository Methods

In this exercise, you will implement various methods in the `MovieRepository` class, responsible for interacting with the MoviesDbContext to perform CRUD operations on movie data.

## Task:

Your goal is to complete the implementation of the methods in the `MovieRepository` class. Follow the instructions for each method to ensure accurate and functional behavior.

**1. Implement the `Add` Method:**

   - Open the `MovieRepository` class.
   - Find the `Add` method, which adds a new movie to the database.
   - Implement the method to add the provided movie entity to the `_context.Movies` and save the changes to the database using `_context.SaveChanges()`.

**2. Implement the `Delete` Method:**

   - Locate the `Delete` method in the `MovieRepository`.
   - Implement the method to remove the specified movie entity from the `_context.Movies` and save the changes to the database.

**3. Implement the `FilterMovies` Method:**

   - Find the `FilterMovies` method in the `MovieRepository`. This method filters movies based on the provided year and genre.
   - Implement the method to return a list of movies based on the following conditions:
      - If both `year` and `genre` are null, return all movies.
      - If only `year` is null, return movies filtered by genre.
      - If only `genre` is null, return movies filtered by year.
      - If both `year` and `genre` are provided, return movies filtered by both.

**4. Implement the `GetAll` Method:**

   - Find the `GetAll` method in the `MovieRepository`. This method retrieves all movies from the database.
   - Implement the method to return all movies in the `_context.Movies`.

**5. Implement the `GetById` Method:**

   - Locate the `GetById` method in the `MovieRepository`. This method retrieves a movie by its unique identifier (id).
   - Implement the method to return the movie from `_context.Movies` where the id matches the provided parameter.

**6. Implement the `Update` Method:**

   - Find the `Update` method in the `MovieRepository`. This method updates an existing movie in the database.
   - Implement the method to update the provided movie entity within the `_context.Movies` and save the changes to the database.

## Note:

- Ensure that you handle exceptions and potential errors that may occur during database operations.
- Test each of the implemented methods to verify their correctness and functionality.

By completing this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience in implementing CRUD operations in the `MovieRepository` class, reinforcing your understanding of database interactions in ASP.NET Core applications.

# Exercise: Implementing Movie Service Methods

In this exercise, you will implement various methods in the `MovieService` class, which is responsible for handling business logic related to movies. The service interacts with the `IMovieRepository` to perform operations on movie data.

      - Validate that the `Title` is not empty.
      - Validate that the `Year` is greater than 0.
      - Validate that the `Description` (if provided) does not exceed 250 characters.
      - Convert the `AddMovieDto` to a `Movie` entity.
      - Call the corresponding method in the `_movieRepository` to add the new movie to the database.

**2. Implement the `DeleteMovie` Method:**

   - Find the `DeleteMovie` method in the `MovieService`.
   - Implement the method to delete a movie by its unique identifier (`id`) from the database.
   - Validate if the movie with the specified `id` exists in the database using `_movieRepository.GetById(id)`.
   - Call the corresponding method in the `_movieRepository` to delete the movie.

**3. Implement the `FilterMovies` Method:**

   - Locate the `FilterMovies` method in the `MovieService`. This method filters movies based on the provided `year` and `genre`.
   - Implement the method to perform the following tasks:
      - If `genre` is provided, validate if the value is a valid genre.
      - Call the corresponding method in the `_movieRepository` to filter movies by `year` and `genre`.
      - Convert the filtered movies to a list of `MovieDto` using the provided extension methods.

**4. Implement the `GetAllMovies` Method:**

   - Find the `GetAllMovies` method in the `MovieService`. This method retrieves all movies from the database.
   - Implement the method to call the corresponding method in the `_movieRepository` to get all movies and convert them to a list of `MovieDto`.

**5. Implement the `GetMovieById` Method:**

   - Locate the `GetMovieById` method in the `MovieService`. This method retrieves a movie by its unique identifier (`id`).
   - Implement the method to validate if the movie with the specified `id` exists in the database.
   - Call the corresponding method in the `_movieRepository` to get the movie by `id` and convert it to a `MovieDto`.

**6. Implement the `UpdateMovie` Method:**

   - Find the `UpdateMovie` method in the `MovieService`. This method updates an existing movie in the database.
   - Implement the method to perform the following tasks:
      - Validate that the `Title` is not empty.
      - Validate that the `Year` is greater than 0.
      - Validate that the `Description` (if provided) does not exceed 250 characters.
